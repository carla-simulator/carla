[{{SUMO}}/tests/complex/tutorial/osm_activitygen/eichstaett.osm]({{Source}}tests/complex/tutorial/osm_activitygen/eichstaett.osm)

Map of the German city Eichstätt in the [OpenStreetMap
format](../../OpenStreetMap_file.md). After the map had been exported
from OpenStreetMap, a detail was cut out, unnecessary objects were
deleted and the map has been improved for traffic simulation and for the
conversion with netconvert. The steps are described in [Tutorials/Import
from OpenStreetMap](../../Tutorials/Import_from_OpenStreetMap.md). As
a final step, the XML identifiers were renumbered to positive numbers.
This way, JOSM thinks there are no changes necessary for upload.

You can use this file if you need a road network of a town with about
13,000 inhabitants. All roads were verified to have the right highway
type, speed limit and one-way attribute. All traffic lights of cars (not
all pedestrian lights) were also verified. You can find a corresponding
SUMO network file at
[Tutorials/OSMActivityGen/eichstaett.net.xml](../../Tutorials/OSMActivityGen/eichstaett.net.xml.md).
