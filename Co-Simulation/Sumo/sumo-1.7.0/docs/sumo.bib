  abstract = {Adaptive Traffic Control algorithm is an important strategy to manage
	traffic at an intersection. These are an improvement of vehicle actuated
	signal control, where explicitly strategies are formulated to compute
	the signal timing considering the current traffic state obtained
	from sensors. However, field evaluation of these strategies is cumbersome
	and expensive and hence simulators which model traffic system can
	be a good alternative. The main challenge in this is a good interface
	between the signal control system and the traffic simulators. The
	signal control system needs the state of the junction in terms of
	vehicle occupancy at every instant. On the other hand, traffic simulator
	needs information on whether the signal state has changed. This two
	way communication requires an efficient interface which is similar
	to client-server architecture. The simulator acts as the server where
	as the adaptive control strategy act like client. This paper proposes
	an efficient interface to couple adaptive control strategy and traffic
	simulator. This interface mediates between traffic control system
	and traffic simulator and provides online interaction to simulation
	from the control strategy. This interface facilitates pure procedural
	routines to communicate and is written in C language along with Python/C
	API. Additionally, a module to estimate the vehicular delay due to
	the control strategy is developed. This delay is estimated by defining
	effective length of queue, which is provided as a user input.
	
	
	This interface is tested using SUMO (Simulation for Urban Mobility),
	which is an open source, microscopic, space continuous and time discrete
	simulator developed by German Aerospace Centre. The traffic control
	strategy is analogous to the HCM vehicle actuated traffic control
	except that there is a queue prediction model which computes upper
	limits on the maximum green time. An isolated four arm junction having
	four phases is simulated for various flow conditions. The simulator
	supplied the state of the downstream detector to the traffic control
	algorithm at every simulation step and the control algorithm determines
	the signal time strategies (phase termination, green extension, and
	maximum green time). These strategies are communicated to the simulator.
	These communications were facilitated by the proposed interface.
	The average stopped delay is computed as the performance parameter.
	The interface was also coupled with another traffic simulator (VISSIM)
	and the results are compared. This interface justifies the concept
	of reusability by the evaluation of number of control strategy.},

  abstract = {Vehicles will exchange much information in the future in order to
	efficiently maintain their inner model of the environment. Before
	they can belief received pieces of information, they must evaluate
	their reliability. Trust is a mechanism to estimate this reliability
	based on the sender. As cars often drive the same route, they meet
	each other again and again. They can establish friendship-like relations
	and thus are embedded in a social structure. A trust model depends
	on this social structure. For this reason, we simulate the driving
	pattern of a small town. Within this simulation, all cars are equipped
	with a trust model that continuously monitors the experiences made
	with others. The developed model focuses on direct experiences of
	the individual and not on a system-wide reputation which would depend
	on a central unit. It continuously evaluates the performance and
	reputation of other cars and includes a feedback loop to faster adapt
	to changes in the other’s behaviour. To make a decision out of the
	collected data, the model uses the capacity of the binary error and
	erasure channel from information theory. This capacity provides a
	better decision criterion than the traditional expectation value.
	The proposed trust model is an individual-level model; nonetheless
	it can be connected to a system-wide reputation mechanism.},

  abstract = {We study the impact of global traffic light control strategies in
	a recently proposed cellular automaton model for vehicular traffic
	in city networks. The model combines basic ideas of the Biham-Middleton-Levine
	model for city traffic and the Nagel-Schreckenberg model for highway
	traffic. The city network has a simple square lattice geometry. All
	streets and intersections are treated equally, i.e., there are no
	dominant streets. Starting from a simple synchronized strategy, we
	show that the capacity of the network strongly depends on the cycle
	times of the traffic lights. Moreover, we point out that the optimal
	time periods are determined by the geometric characteristics of the
	network, i.e., the distance between the intersections. In the case
	of synchronized traffic lights, the derivation of the optimal cycle
	times in the network can be reduced to a simpler problem, the flow
	optimization of a single street with one traffic light operating
	as a bottleneck. In order to obtain an enhanced throughput in the
	model, improved global strategies are tested, e.g., green wave and
	random switching strategies, which lead to surprising results.},

	sever observers along a one-lane rural road, given as boundary conditions
	the flow into this road and the flow out of it. By using nonlinear
	optimization, for each of the models the best matching set of parameters
	have been estimated. For this particular data set, the models that
	performed best are the ones with the smalles number of parameters.
	The average error rate of the models is about 16 %, however, this

	The contribution of this paper is to compare some of these models

	is done by simplifying the multilane reality to a simulation of only
	single lane. The results show that by simulating the multilane road
	with single lane models, calibration errors (Theil?s U, root mean
	squared error) of 14 % to 16 % can be obtained. A validation of the
	models ?which means taking calibrated parameters of one data set
	to reproduce the other data sets? gives additional errors of about
	0.5 to 2.5 percentage points. This is in good agreement with other
	calibration/validation approaches performed recently.},

  abstract = {Microscopic simulation models are becoming increasingly important
	tools in modelling transport systems. They are applied in simulation
	programs for transport planning, traffic forecasting and advanced
	vehicle control and safety systems (AVCSS). An important part of
	the models are the microscopic sub-models which describe the interaction
	between adjacent vehicles. For that purpose rules and equations are
	defined describing the car-following and lane changing behaviour
	of the vehicles. An essential problem is the calibration and validation
	of the parameters used in these rules. In this paper ten microscopic
	traffic flow models of very different kind are analysed concerning
	the correct reproduction of the car-following behaviour on single
	lane roads. The models are calibrated and validated with data collected
	via DGPS-equipped cars (Differential Global Positioning System) on
	a test track in Japan. The positions of the cars are delivered every
	0.1 second with very high accuracy, which is perfect for analysing
	the car following behaviour. To calibrate the models, in each case
	one driver pair is under consideration. The measured data of a leading
	car are fed into the model under consideration and the model is used
	to compute the behaviour of a following car. In the analysis the
	resulting simulated time series of headways are carried out and the
	deviations to the measured headways are calculated to calibrate the
	models. To find the optimal parameters an automated optimisation
	technique is used which tries to minimise the deviations. For validation
	purposes the resulting optimal parameter sets for single data sets
	are taken to reproduce some other data sets by simulation. At first,
	this is done in a driver independent way, where the drivers in the
	data set used for the calibration are different from those used for
	the validation. Secondly, to investigate whether individual driver
	behaviour can be reproduced better a driver-special validation is
	conducted, where the calibrated parameter sets obtained for each
	driver are taken to validate the behaviour of the same driver in
	other situations. Main results of the analyses are that all models
	produce nearly the same errors, thus sophisticated models with up
	to 15 parameters seem not to be better than simple models with only
	4 or 6 parameters. In total it is found that the differences in the
	driver behaviour are much bigger than the diversity of the models.
	At last, the validation with special driver pairs produces slightly
	better results than the driver-independent validation. Thus, the
	behaviour of individual drivers can be reproduced a bit more accurately
	than trying to transfer optimal parameter results from one driver
	to another.},

	In this work various microscopic traffic flow models have been tested
	from a very microscopic point of view concerning the car-following
	behavior and gap-acceptance. The data used for calibration and validation
	is from car-following experiments performed in Japan in October 2001.
	The data have been collected by letting nine DGPS-equipped cars follow
	a lead car driving along a 3 km test track for about 15-30 minutes.
	So one gets the positions and speeds of each car in time intervals
	of 0.1 seconds. The experiment was repeated eight times letting the
	leading driver perform various driving patterns as there are constant
	speeds of 20, 40, 60 and 80 km/h for some time, driving in waves
	and emulating many accelerations/decelerations as they are typical
	at intersections. To minimize driver-dependent correlations between
	the data sets, the drivers were exchanged between the cars regularly
	after each experiment.
	
	
	In this paper we present analyses concerning four of the experiments,
	namely the patterns mostly with intervals of constant speeds and
	wave-performing. For each of the four experiments one gets the ten
	trajectories of the cars in form of the DGPS-positions and speeds.
	From these the accelerations and distances/gaps between the cars
	have been calculated, which are used then for the simulation runs.<br/>
	
	The study was done analyzing the time-development of the gaps between
	the cars. For the simulation setup only two cars are considered at
	a time. The leading car is updated as the speeds in the recorded
	data sets tell and the following car is updated as defined by the
	equations and rules of the used model, respectively. The absolute
	error a model produces is calculated via the simple quadratic distance
	between the recorded gaps and the simulated gaps. To get a percentage
	error it is additionally related to the mean average gap in each
	data set. Altogether 36 vehicle pairs (4 experiments * 9 vehicle
	pairs) were used as data sets for the analyses.
	
	
	Each model has been calibrated with each of the 36 different constellations
	separately gaining optimal parameter sets for each ?model - data
	set? combination. To find the optimal parameter constellations a
	gradient-free optimization method was used and started several times
	with different initialization values for each ?model - data set?
	pair. The variation in initialization is done to avoid sticking with
	a local minimum, which of course can occur because getting a global
	minimum can not be guaranteed by those type of optimization algorithms.
	Subsequently, the validation was performed by determining the error
	of a given model on all the data sets which have not been used to
	calibrate the model.
	
	
	By now, ten microscopic models of a very different kind using 3 to
	14 parameters have been tested. The most basic parameters used by
	the models are the car length, a maximum velocity, an acceleration
	and mostly a deceleration rate. The acceleration and deceleration
	rates are specified in more detail in some models depending on the
	recent speed or traffic states (indicated by density for example).
	Furthermore, some models use a parameter for random braking or another
	kind of stochastic parameter describing individual driver behavior.
	Finally, few models use much more parameters to describe the driver?s
	behavior, which will be briefly described in the final paper. As
	the time step for the models is 0.1 seconds according to the recorded
	data, some models with a traditional time step of 1 second ? as for
	example used for simple cellular automatons - have been modified
	to adopt for an arbitrarily small time-step. So far the models tested
	are as follows (more will be added): - CA (cellular automaton model
	by K. Nagel, M. Schreckenberg), - SK-model (model by S. Krauss),
	- OVM (?Optimal Velocity Model?, Bando, Hasebe), - IDM (?Intelligent
	Driver Model?, Helbing), - IDMM (?Intelligent Driver Model with Memory?,
	Helbing, Treiber), - CATauT (CA model with more variable acceleration
	and deceleration, own development), - GIPPSLIKE (basic model by P.G.
	Gipps), - Aerde (model used in the simulation package INTEGRATION),
	- FRITZSCHE (model used in the british software PARAMICS; it is similar
	to what is used in the german software VISSIM by PTV), - MitSim (model
	by Yang, Koutsopulus, used in the software MitSim).
	
	
	The error rates of the models in comparison to the data sets during
	the calibration for each model reach from 9 to 24 %. But no model
	appears to be significantly the best one since every model has the
	same problems with distinct data sets and other data sets can be
	simulated quite good with each model. Interestingly, it can be stated
	that models with more parameters than others do not necessarily reproduce
	the real data better. The results of the validation process draw
	a similar picture. The produced errors in these cases are about 12
	to 30 %, sometimes up to 40 or 60%, which is of course much bigger
	than in the simple calibration cases. All in all the results after
	the calibration agree with some results that have been obtained before.
	But the results of the validation are in parts very bad which probably
	calls for the development of much better models. The other way to
	interpret the results is that ? from this microscopic point of view
	? errors of about 12-30 % can probably not be suppressed no matter
	what a model is used. This would be due to the different behavior
	of each driver.},

  abstract = {Traffic simulation has been extensively used as a decision support
	tool for efficient traffic management in daily life. During disasters
	and incidents, traffic simulation can further help rescue teams to
	understand the current traffic state and the possible impacts of
	proposed strategies and then to make proper decisions. At this point,
	the changes in traffic demand should also be considered in the simulation
	to reflect the latest traffic state. In this paper, a demand-oriented
	traffic management system for disasters and incidents with a web-based
	portal is introduced. In this system, not only the real-time data
	from loop and wireless detectors but also traffic simulation are
	used for reconstructing and predicting the traffic state. Furthermore,
	four traffic demand categories for disasters and incidents are proposed
	in the system. Some respective demand characteristics are collected
	according to historical cases, such as departure pattern and people?s
	perception about evacuation. Such characteristics will be used in
	the system, since they have a great influence on the simulated traffic
	state and the effectiveness of applied strategies. Finally, the approach
	how to generate the respective special demands for disasters and
	incidents with consideration of the normal traffic demand is proposed
	as well. },

	a methodology to model and simulate ITS applications with iTETRIS
	around three main mechanisms: (i) message management with generic
	open APIs based on subscription/result container mechanisms (ii)
	data management with the integration of an application facilities
	layer in the iCS, including a local dynamic map (LDM), (iii) application
	management with an ITS application simulator including one or more
	application logics. Second, we apply this methodology to implement
	the following four ITS applications: dynamic route planning, bus
	lane management, emergency vehicle, and contextual speed adaptation.
	We describe their integrations in iTETRIS, including a characterization
	of their interactions with the iCS, and illustrate the benefits of
	these ITS applications on traffic efficiency, gasoline consumption,

	large variety of vehicle types, considering differences between passenger
	and heavy duty vehicles, the engine displacement, the fuel type,
	and the EURO emission norm of the vehicles. This database was reformulated
	into a microscopic model which uses the vehicle class, the vehicle?s
	speed and the vehicle?s acceleration for computing the amount of
	a certain pollutant?s emission within one discrete time step. The
	kind of this model?s embedding within SUMO allows to collect and
	to evaluate the ecological impacts of traffic management strategies
	on per-vehicle, per-lane, and per-road base. Using this information,
	two sub-topics of traffic management were addressed: ecological routing

  abstract = {Research on autonomous vehicles has come a long way since first findings,
	and its software tools
	
	are increasingly acclaimed by the research community. Particularly
	with robotics simulators, autonomous
	
	vehicles were provided with a suitable test-bed for experimentation
	of new methodologies
	
	such as long-term navigation algorithms, map building and intelligent
	reasoning. However,
	
	when it concerns the deployment and validation of such vehicles in
	a larger urban traffic scenario,
	
	robotics simulators do not seem to provide the required functionality
	for road traffic analysis, or
	
	inter-vehicular communication infrastructure as they seem present
	in today’s traffic simulators.
	
	The improvement of such features is the key for the successful practical
	deployment of such a
	
	critical system.
	
	
	The main objective of this dissertation is the integration of two
	types of simulators, namely a
	
	robotics and a traffic simulator. This integration will enable autonomous
	vehicles to be deployed
	
	in a rather realistic traffic flow as an agent entity (on the traffic
	simulator), at the same time it
	
	simulates all its sensors and actuators (on the robotics counterpart).
	Also, the statistical tools
	
	available in the traffic simulator will allow practitioners to infer
	what kind of advantages such a
	
	novel technology will bring to our everyday’s lives. Furthermore,
	the current features and issues on
	
	current robotics and traffic simulators are presented and a taxonomy
	for selecting these simulators
	
	is proposed. An architecture for the integration of the aforementioned
	simulators is proposed and
	
	implemented in the light of the most desired features of such software
	environments.
	
	
	To assess the usefulness of the platform architecture towards the
	expected realistic simulation
	
	facility, a comprehensive system evaluation is also performed and
	critically reviewed, leveraging
	
	the feasibility of the integration. Further developments and future
	perspectives are pinpointed up
	
	in the end.},

  abstract = {The enhancement of road safety and traffic efficiency are the focus
	of many endeavours in science, economy and politics. A traditional
	approach is to increase vehicle safety by advanced and intelligent
	onboard systems using high developed sensors for the monitoring of
	the vehicle?s surrounding. However, these technologies are vehicle-autonomous
	solutions that only consider information coming from onboard sensors.
	These sensors are normally based on optical, ultra-sonic, radar or
	video camera systems and can only detect other vehicles or other
	objects along a line-of-sight up to the next obstacle. The view beyond
	a truck cruising just in front of the vehicle, for example, is not
	possible.
	
	
	New approaches are now dealing with co-operative technologies that
	enable the exchange of important information between vehicles and
	infrastructures for updated traffic data acquisition, recognition
	of traffic congestion due to accidents or other sudden incidents,
	local dynamic map data updates and driver warning. One key technology
	within such co-operative systems is the highly precise relative positioning
	between vehicles and the monitoring of the broader vehicle environment
	using ad-hoc data networks. These technologies can be primarily based
	on satellite systems like GPS or GALILEO supplemented by other onboard
	sensor data, whereby unprocessed sensor data and satellite pseudo
	range information will be exchanged between the vehicles within a
	dedicated radio range. These data, when compared with the onboard
	data, will finally enable the creation of virtual images of a vehicle?s
	surrounding using special microscopic traffic modelling algorithms.

	vicinity and computing an optimized speed in order to avoid braking
	and acceleration maneuvers. Previous studies have demonstrated the
	potential environmental benefit in small-scale simulation scenarios.
	To assess the overall benefit, large-scale simulations are required.
	In order to ensure computational feasibility, the applied simulation
	models need to be simplified as far as possible without sacrificing
	credibility. Therefore this work presents the results of a sensitivity
	analysis and identifies gear choice and the distance from the traffic
	light at which vehicles are informed as key influencing factors.
	Our results indicate that a suboptimal gear choice can void the benefits
	of the speed adaptation. Furthermore, we present first results of
	a scale-up simulation using a real-world inner-city road network
	and discuss the range in which we expect the saving in fuel consumption
	to be in reality.},

	of information on the existing matrix estimation models and on the
	accuracy of O-D matrix estimation has not been broadly investigated.
	Also, traffic phenomenon in networks becomes complicated and difficult
	to explain with the increase in number of vehicles, variety of daily
	activities and sophisticated travel behaviors. As such, general congested
	traffic state as well as diverse travelers? perception about travel
	time should be taken into consideration in O-D matrix estimation

	the performance of the Information minimization (IM) and the modified

	has adverse effect on the accuracy of matrix estimation, whereas
	additional turning flow information can improve estimation accuracy.
	Based on the examination results a methodology using the IM model,
	the stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) assignment and the information
	screening process, was proposed to optimize the goodness of estimation
	and enhance the IM model to deal with the traffic situation more
	realistically. The respective convergence and required computation
