// \brief The configuration settings for the \c SensorView to be provided
// by the environment simulation.
//
// This message can be provided by the sensor model to the environment
// simulation, in which case it describes the input configuration that
// is desired by the sensor model. In response the environment simulation
// will configure the input and provide a new message of this type, which
// describes the actual configuration that it is going to employ. The two
// can and will differ, when either the environment simulation does not
// support a given requested configuration, and/or when the requested
// configuration allowed for multiple alternatives, in which case the set
// configuration will only contain the alternative chosen.
//
// It should be noted that this message is not intended to provide for
// parametrization of a generic sensor model, but rather for the automatic
// configuration of an environment simulation in order to supply the
// necessary input to it, depending on its actual configuration.
// Mechanisms to parametrize sensor models are currently packaging-specific,
// i.e. they depend on the packaging mechanism chosen:  For FMU-packaging
// the parametrization can be implemented using normal FMU parameters,
// and the requested \c SensorViewConfiguration can depend on those parameter
// values by being defined as a calculatedParameter.
//
// The sensor-technology specific configurations are intended to allow
// sensor models to use useful sensor modeling base capabilities of the
// environment simulation (e.g. ray tracing engines, camera/lens image
// generation), which need configuration by the sensor model to supply
// suitable data. The specified details are not directly related to
// sensor details, but rather provide the necessary base machinery
// setup so that the data provided is suitable to model the sensor to
// a sufficient degree of fidelity internally. For example the number
// of rays parameters for the Lidar configuration does not match one to
// one with the number of laser rays a lidar sensor might cast, but
// rather specifies the number of rays being cast by a ray
// casting/tracing engine, which might be many more than the physical
// rays being cast at any point in time.
//
// This also implies that for sensors that have dynamically varying
// characteristics (e.g. switching between wide and narrow focus,
// switching update rates, etc.), the basic approach is to specify
// the maximum amount of data needed at all times here, and internally
// select the data that is needed at any point in time.
//
// In order to optimize the workload and bandwidth needed for sensor
// simulation, OSI packaging mechanisms can specify the ability to
// exchange \c SensorViewConfiguration messages not only prior to
// simulation startup, but also dynamically during simulation runs,
// thereby allowing dynamic input configuration switching to only
// request data that is needed in the current sensor mode. However
// this is more or less only a resource optimization strategy, and
// since providing fine-grained information like this can reveal
// internal characteristics of the sensor and/or sensor model, will
// not always be the preferred approach for reasons of IP protection.
