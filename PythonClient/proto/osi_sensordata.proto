// \brief The sensor information derived from \c GroundTruth and processed by
// sensor-models.
//
// The sensor information is supposed to imitate the output of real sensors.
// All information regarding the environment is given with respect to
// the virtual sensor coordinate system specified in
// \c SensorData::mounting_position, except for feature data, which is given
// with respect to the physical sensor coordinate system specified in the
// corresponding physical sensor's coordinate system.
//
// When simulating multiple distinct sensors, each sensor can produce an
// individual copy of the \c SensorData interface. This allows an independent
// treatment of the sensors.
//
// Sensor fusion models can consolidate multiple \c SensorData interfaces into
// one consolidated \c SensorData interface.  This can happen either in
// seperate logical models, consuming and producing \c SensorData interfaces,
// or it can happen as part of a combined sensor/logical model, that consumes
// \c SensorView interfaces and directly produces one consolidated \c SensorData
// output.
