CARLA HD maps
=============

This folder contains HD Maps for the various towns provided with CARLA.

The PointCloud files are using the same coordinate system as CARLA.
This is a left-handed coordinate system with x and y as ground plane and z axis up.

Please be aware that PointCloud tools (especially the PointCloud Viewer "pcl_viewer") is assuming
a right-handed coordinate system, so it displays everything in a mirrored fashion.
