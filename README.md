CARLA is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and
validation of autonomous driving systems. In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings,
vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and
environmental conditions.

Building CARLA
--------------

Clone this repository locally from GitHub:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla.git .
```

Also, clone the [CARLA fork of the Unreal Engine](https://github.com/CarlaUnreal/UnrealEngine) into an appropriate location:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 -b carla https://github.com/CarlaUnreal/UnrealEngine.git .
```

Once you have cloned the repositories, follow the instructions for [building in Linux][buildlinuxlink] or [building in Windows][buildwindowslink].

Unreal Engine 4 follows its [own license terms](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/faq).

CARLA uses three dependencies as part of the SUMO integration:
- [PROJ](https://proj.org/), a generic coordinate transformation software which uses the [X/MIT open source license](https://proj.org/about.html#license).
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org), part of the PROJ dependencies, which is [in the public domain](https://www.sqlite.org/purchase/license).

CARLA uses one dependency as part of the Chrono integration:
- [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), a C++ template library for linear algebra which uses the [MPL2 license](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/).

CARLA uses the Autodesk FBX SDK for converting FBX to OBJ in the import process of maps. This step is optional, and the SDK is located [here](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/fbx-sdk-2020-0)
