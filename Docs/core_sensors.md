# Sensors and data

Sensors are actors that retrieve data from their surroundings. They are crucial to create learning environment for driving agents.  

This page summarizes everything necessary to start handling sensors. It introduces the types available and a step-by-step guide of their life cycle. The specifics for every sensor can be found in the [sensors reference](ref_sensors.md).

## Sensors step-by-step  

The class [carla.Sensor](python_api.md#carla.Sensor) defines a special type of actor able to measure and stream data.  

* __What is this data?__ It varies a lot depending on the type of sensor. All the types of data are inherited from the general [carla.SensorData](python_api.md#carla.SensorData). 
* __When do they retrieve the data?__ Either on every simulation step or when a certain event is registered. Depends on the type of sensor. 
* __How do they retrieve the data?__ Every sensor has a `listen()` method to receive and manage the data.  

Despite their differences, all the sensors are used in a similar way. 

### Setting

As with every other actor, find the blueprint and set specific attributes. This is essential when handling sensors. Their attributes will determine the results obtained. These are detailed in the [sensors reference](ref_sensors.md). 

The following example sets a dashboard HD camera.

```py
# Find the blueprint of the sensor.
blueprint = world.get_blueprint_library().find('sensor.camera.rgb')
# Modify the attributes of the blueprint to set image resolution and field of view.
blueprint.set_attribute('image_size_x', '1920')
blueprint.set_attribute('image_size_y', '1080')
blueprint.set_attribute('fov', '110')
# Set the time in seconds between sensor captures
blueprint.set_attribute('sensor_tick', '1.0')
``` 

### Spawning

`attachment_to` and `attachment_type`, are crucial. Sensors should be attached to a parent actor, usually a vehicle, to follow it around and gather the information. The attachment type will determine how its position is updated regarding said vehicle. 

* __Rigid attachment.__ Movement is strict regarding its parent location. This is the proper attachment to retrieve data from the simulation.  
* __SpringArm attachment.__ Movement is eased with little accelerations and decelerations. This attachment is only recommended to record videos from the simulation. The movement is smooth and "hops" are avoided when updating the cameras' positions.  

```py
transform = carla.Transform(carla.Location(x=0.8, z=1.7))
sensor = world.spawn_actor(blueprint, transform, attach_to=my_vehicle)
```
!!! Important
    When spawning with attachment, location must be relative to the parent actor.  

### Listening

Every sensor has a [`listen()`](python_api.md#carla.Sensor.listen) method. This is called every time the sensor retrieves data.  

The argument `callback` is a [lambda function](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp). It describes what should the sensor do when data is retrieved. This must have the data retrieved as an argument.  

```py
# do_something() will be called each time a new image is generated by the camera.
sensor.listen(lambda data: do_something(data))

...

# This collision sensor would print everytime a collision is detected. 
def callback(event):
    for actor_id in event:
        vehicle = world_ref().get_actor(actor_id)
        print('Vehicle too close: %s' % vehicle.type_id)

sensor02.listen(callback)
```

### Data

Most sensor data objects have a function to save the information to disk. This will allow it to be used in other environments.  

Sensor data differs a lot between sensor types. Take a look at the [sensors reference](ref_sensors.md) to get a detailed explanation. However, all of them are always tagged with some basic information.  

| Sensor data attribute                                                                  | Type                                                                                   | Description                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `frame`                                                                                | int                                                                                    | Frame number when the measurement took place.                                          |
| `timestamp`                                                                            | double                                                                                 | Timestamp of the measurement in simulation seconds since the beginning of the episode. |
| `transform`                                                                            | [carla.Transform](<../python_api#carlatransform>)                                      | World reference of the sensor at the time of the measurement.                          |

<br>



!!! Important
    `is_listening` is a __sensor attribute__ that enables/disables data listening at will.  
    `sensor_tick` is a __blueprint attribute__ that sets the simulation time between data received.

### Cameras

Take a shot of the world from their point of view. For cameras that return [carla.Image](<../python_api#carlaimage>), you can use the helper class [carla.ColorConverter](python_api.md#carla.ColorConverter) to modify the image to represent different information.

* __Retrieve data__ every simulation step.

That is a wrap on sensors and how do these retrieve simulation data.  

Thus concludes the introduction to CARLA. However there is yet a lot to learn.

* __Continue learning.__ There are some advanced features in CARLA: rendering options, traffic 
  manager, the recorder, and some more. This is a great moment to learn more about them.
