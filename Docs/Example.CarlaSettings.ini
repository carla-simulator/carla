; This file can be loaded with the Python client to be sent to the server. It
; defines the parameters to be used when requesting a new episode.
;
; Note that server specific variables are only loaded when launching the
; simulator. Use it with `./CarlaUE4.sh -carla-settings=Path/To/This/File`.

[CARLA/Server]
; If set to false, a mock controller will be used instead of waiting for a real
; client to connect. (Server only)
UseNetworking=false
; Ports to use for the server-client communication. This can be overridden by
; the command-line switch `-world-port=N`, write and read ports will be set to
; N+1 and N+2 respectively. (Server only)

; Time-out in milliseconds for the networking operations. (Server only)
ServerTimeOut=10000
; In synchronous mode, CARLA waits every frame until the control from the client
; is received.
SynchronousMode=true
; Send info about every non-player agent in the scene every frame, the
; information is attached to the measurements message. This includes other
; vehicles, pedestrians and traffic signs. Disabled by default to improve
; performance.

; considerably faster. Available: Low or Epic.

[CARLA/Sensor]
; Names of the sensors to be attached to the player, comma-separated, each of
; them should be defined in its own subsection.

; Uncomment next line to add a camera called MyCamera to the vehicle
; Sensors=MyCamera

; or uncomment next line to add a camera and a Lidar
; Sensors=MyCamera,MyLidar

; or uncomment next line to add a regular camera and a depth camera
; Sensors=MyCamera,MyCamera/Depth

; Now, every camera we added needs to be defined it in its own subsection.
[CARLA/Sensor/MyCamera]
; Type of the sensor. The available types are:
;   * CAMERA                        A scene capture camera.
;   * LIDAR_RAY_CAST                A Lidar implementation based on ray-casting.
SensorType=CAMERA
; Post-processing effect to be applied to this camera. Valid values:
;   * None                  No effects applied.
;   * SceneFinal            Post-processing present at scene (bloom, fog, etc).
;   * Depth                 Depth map ground-truth only.
;   * SemanticSegmentation  Semantic segmentation ground-truth only.
PostProcessing=SceneFinal
; Size of the captured image in pixels.

[CARLA/Sensor/MyCamera/Depth]
; The sensor can be defined in a subsection of MyCamera so it inherits the
; values in MyCamera. This adds a camera similar to MyCamera but generating
; depth map images instead.
