# CARLA Documentation

Welcome to the CARLA documentation.

This home page contains an index with a brief description of the different sections in the documentation. Feel free to read in whatever order preferred. In any case, here are a few suggestions for newcomers.

* __Install CARLA.__ Either follow the [Quick start installation](start_quickstart.md) to get a CARLA release or [make the build](build_linux.md) for a desired platform.
* __Start using CARLA.__ The section titled [First steps](core_concepts.md) is an introduction to the most important concepts.
* __Check the API.__ there is a handy [Python API reference](python_api.md) to look up the classes and methods available.

The CARLA forum is available to post any doubts or suggestions that may arise during the reading.
