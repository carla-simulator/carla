  classes:
  - class_name: Actor
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      CARLA defines actors as anything that plays a role in the simulation or can be moved around. That includes: pedestrians, vehicles, sensors and traffic signs (considering traffic lights as part of these). Actors are spawned in the simulation by carla.World and they need for a carla.ActorBlueprint to be created. These blueprints belong into a library provided by CARLA, find more about them [here](bp_library.md).
    # - PROPERTIES -------------------------
    instance_variables:
    - var_name: attributes
      type: dict
      doc: >
        A dictionary containing the attributes of the blueprint this actor was based on.
    - var_name: id
      type: int
      doc: >
        Identifier for this actor. Unique during a given episode.
    - var_name: is_alive
      type: bool
      doc: >
        Returns whether this object was destroyed using this actor handle.
    - var_name: parent
      type: carla.Actor
      doc: >
        Actors may be attached to a parent actor that they will follow around. This is said actor.
    - var_name: semantic_tags
      type: list(int)
      doc: >
        A list of semantic tags provided by the blueprint listing components for this actor. E.g. a traffic light could be tagged with `Pole` and `TrafficLight`. These tags are used by the semantic segmentation sensor. Find more about this and other sensors [here](ref_sensors.md#semantic-segmentation-camera).

  - class_name: WalkerAIController
    parent: carla.Actor
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      Class that conducts AI control for a walker. The controllers are defined as actors, but they are quite different from the rest. They need to be attached to a parent actor during their creation, which is the walker they will be controlling (take a look at carla.World if you are yet to learn on how to spawn actors). They also need for a special blueprint (already defined in carla.BlueprintLibrary as "controller.ai.walker"). This is an empty blueprint, as the AI controller will be invisible in the simulation but will follow its parent around to dictate every step of the way.

    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      Traffic signs appearing in the simulation except for traffic lights. These have their own class inherited from this in carla.TrafficLight. Right now, speed signs, stops and yields are mainly the ones implemented, but many others are borne in mind.
    # - PROPERTIES -------------------------
    instance_variables:
    - var_name: trigger_volume
      doc: >
        A carla.BoundingBox situated near a traffic sign where the carla.Actor who is inside can know about it.

  - class_name: TrafficLight
    parent: carla.TrafficSign
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      A traffic light actor, considered a specific type of traffic sign. As traffic lights will mostly appear at junctions, they belong to a group which contains the different traffic lights in it. Inside the group, traffic lights are differenciated by their pole index.
           
        Within a group the state of traffic lights is changed in a cyclic pattern: one index is chosen and it spends a few seconds in green, yellow and eventually red. The rest of the traffic lights remain frozen in red this whole time, meaning that there is a gap in the last seconds of the cycle where all the traffic lights are red. However, the state of a traffic light can be changed manually.  
    # - PROPERTIES -------------------------
