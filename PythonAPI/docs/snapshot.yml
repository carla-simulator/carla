  # - CLASSES ------------------------------

  classes:
  - class_name: WorldSnapshot
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      This snapshot comprises all the information for every actor on scene at a certain moment of time. It creates and gives acces to a data structure containing a series of carla.ActorSnapshot. The client recieves a new snapshot on every tick that cannot be stored.  
    # - PROPERTIES -------------------------
    instance_variables:
    - var_name: id
      type: int
      doc: >
        A value unique for every snapshot to differenciate them. 
    - var_name: frame
      type: int
      doc: >
        Simulation frame in which the snapshot was taken. 
    - var_name: timestamp
      type: carla.Timestamp
      var_units: seconds
      doc: >
         Precise moment in time when snapshot was taken. This class works in seconds as given by the operative system.

      return: carla.ActorSnapshot
      params: 
        - param_name: actor_id
          type: int
      doc: > 
        Given a certain actor ID, returns its corresponding snapshot or <b>None</b> if it is not found. 
    # --------------------------------------
    - def_name: has_actor
      return: bool
      params:
        - param_name: actor_id
          type: int
      doc: >
        Given a certain actor ID, checks if there is a snapshot corresponding it and so, if the actor was present at that moment.
    # --------------------------------------
    - def_name: __iter__
      doc: >
        Iterate over the carla.ActorSnapshot stored in the snapshot.  
    # --------------------------------------
    - def_name: __len__
      return: int
      doc: >
        Returns the amount of carla.ActorSnapshot present in this snapshot.

    - def_name: __eq__
      return: bool
      params:
        - param_name: other
          type: carla.WorldSnapshot
      doc: >
        Returns __True__ if both **<font color="#f8805a">timestamp</font>** are the same. 
    # --------------------------------------
    - def_name: __ne__
      return: bool
      params:
        - param_name: other
          type: carla.WorldSnapshot
      doc: >
        Returns <b>True</b> if both **<font color="#f8805a">timestamp</font>** are different. 
    # --------------------------------------

  - class_name: ActorSnapshot
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      A class that comprises all the information for an actor at a certain moment in time. These objects are contained in a carla.WorldSnapshot and sent to the client once every tick. 
    # - PROPERTIES -------------------------
    instance_variables:
    - var_name: id
      type: int
      doc: >
        An identifier for the snapshot itself. 
    # - METHODS ----------------------------
    methods:
    - def_name: get_acceleration
      return: carla.Vector3D
      return_units: m/s<sup>2</sup>
      doc: >
        Returns the acceleration vector registered for an actor in that tick. 
    # --------------------------------------
    - def_name: get_angular_velocity
      return: carla.Vector3D
      return_units: rad/s
      doc: >
        Returns the angular velocity vector registered for an actor in that tick.
    # --------------------------------------
    - def_name: get_transform
      return: carla.Transform
      doc: >
        Returns the actor's transform (location and rotation) for an actor in that tick. 
    # --------------------------------------
    - def_name: get_velocity
      return: carla.Vector3D
      return_units: m/s
      doc: >
