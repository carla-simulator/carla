      <br><br>
      __Note on double types:__ Lane markings are defined under the OpenDRIVE standard that determines whereas a line will be considered "BrokenSolid" or "SolidBroken". For each road there is a center lane marking, defined from left to right regarding the lane's directions. The rest of the lane markings are defined in order from the center lane to the closest outside of the road.

  - class_name: Map
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      Class containing the road information and waypoint managing. Data is retrieved from an OpenDRIVE file that describes the road. A query system is defined which works hand in hand with carla.Waypoint to translate geometrical information from the .xodr to natural world points. CARLA is currently working with [OpenDRIVE 1.4 standard](http://www.opendrive.org/docs/OpenDRIVEFormatSpecRev1.4H.pdf).
    # - PROPERTIES -------------------------
    instance_variables:
    - var_name: name
      type: str

    doc: >
      Waypoints in CARLA are described as 3D directed points. They have a carla.Transform which locates the waypoint in a road and orientates it according to the lane. They also store the road information belonging to said point regarding its lane and lane markings.  
      <br><br>

  - class_name: Landmark
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      Class that defines any type of traffic landmark or sign affecting a road. These class mediates between the [OpenDRIVE 1.4 standard](http://www.opendrive.org/docs/OpenDRIVEFormatSpecRev1.4H.pdf) definition of the landmarks and their representation in the simulation.
      This class retrieves all the information defining a landmark in OpenDRIVE and facilitates information about which lanes does it affect and when.

      Landmarks will be accessed by carla.Waypoint objects trying to retrieve the regulation of their lane. Therefore some attributes depend on the waypoint that is consulting the landmark and so, creating the object.
    # - PROPERTIES -------------------------
    instance_variables:
    - var_name: road_id
      type: int
      doc: >
        The OpenDRIVE ID of the road where this landmark is defined. Due to OpenDRIVE road definitions, this road may be different from the road the landmark is currently affecting. It is mostly the case in junctions where the road diverges in different routes.

        <small>Example: a traffic light is defined in one of the divergent roads in a junction, but it affects all the possible routes</small>
    - var_name: distance
      type: float
      var_units: meters
      doc: >
        Distance between the landmark and the waypoint creating the object (querying `get_landmarks` or `get_landmarks_of_type`).
    - var_name: s
      type: float
      var_units: meters
      doc: >
        Distance where the landmark is positioned along the geometry of the road `road_id`.
    - var_name: t
      type: float
      var_units: meters
      doc: >
        Lateral distance where the landmark is positioned from the edge of the road `road_id`.
    - var_name: id
      type: str
      doc: >
        Unique ID of the landmark in the OpenDRIVE file.
    - var_name: name
      type: str
      doc: >
        Name of the landmark in the in the OpenDRIVE file.
    - var_name: is_dynamic
      type: bool
      doc: >
        Indicates if the landmark has state changes over time such as traffic lights.
    - var_name: orientation
      type: carla.LandmarkOrientation
      var_units: degrees
      doc: >
        Indicates which lanes the landmark is facing towards to.
    - var_name: z_offset
      type: float
      var_units: meters
      doc: >
        Height where the landmark is placed.
    - var_name: country
      type: str
      doc: >
        Country code where the landmark is defined (default to OpenDRIVE is Germany 2017).
    - var_name: type
      type: str
      doc: >
        Type identificator of the landmark according to the country code.
    - var_name: sub_type
      type: str
      doc: >
        Subtype identificator of the landmark according to the country code.
    - var_name: value
      type: float
      doc: >
        Value printed in the signal (e.g. speed limit, maximum weight, etc).
    - var_name: unit
      type: str
      doc: >
        Units of measurement for the attribute `value`.
    - var_name: height
      type: float
      var_units: meters
      doc: >
        Total height of the signal.
    - var_name: width
      type: float
      var_units: meters
      doc: >
        Total width of the signal.
    - var_name: text
      type: str
      doc: >
        Additional text in the signal.
    - var_name: h_offset
      type: float
      var_units: meters
      doc: >
        Orientation offset of the signal relative to the the definition of `road_id` at `s` in OpenDRIVE.
    - var_name: pitch
      type: float
      var_units: meters
      doc: >
        Pitch rotation of the signal (Y-axis in [UE coordinates system](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carlarotation)).
    - var_name: roll
      type: float
      doc: >
        Roll rotation of the signal (X-axis in [UE coordinates system](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carlarotation)).
    - var_name: waypoint
      type: carla.Waypoint
      doc: >
        A waypoint placed in the lane of the one that made the query and at the `s` of the landmark. It is the first waypoint for which the landmark will be effective.
    - var_name: transform
      type: carla.Transform
      doc: >
        The location and orientation of the landmark in the simulation.
    # - METHODS ----------------------------
    methods:
    - def_name: get_lane_validities
      return: list(tuple(int))
      doc: >
        Returns which lanes the landmark is affecting to. As there may be specific lanes where the landmark is not effective, the return is a list of pairs containing ranges of the __lane_id__ affected:

        <small>Example: In a road with 5 lanes, being 3 not affected: [(from_lane1,to_lane2),(from_lane4,to_lane5)]</small>
