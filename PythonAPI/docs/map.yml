      <br><br>
      __Note on double types:__ Lane markings are defined under the OpenDRIVE standard that determines whereas a line will be considered "BrokenSolid" or "SolidBroken". For each road there is a center lane marking, defined from left to right regarding the lane's directions. The rest of the lane markings are defined in order from the center lane to the closest outside of the road.

  - class_name: Map
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      Class containing the road information and waypoint managing. Data is retrieved from an OpenDRIVE file that describes the road. A query system is defined which works hand in hand with carla.Waypoint to translate geometrical information from the .xodr to natural world points. CARLA is currently working with [OpenDRIVE 1.4 standard](http://www.opendrive.org/docs/OpenDRIVEFormatSpecRev1.4H.pdf).

  - class_name: LandmarkType
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      Helper class containing a set of commonly used landmark types as defined by the default country code in the [OpenDRIVE standard](http://opendrive.org/docs/OpenDRIVEFormatSpecRev1.5M.pdf) (Germany 2017).

      __carla.Landmark does not reference this class__. The landmark type is a string that varies greatly depending on the country code being used. This class only makes it easier to manage some of the most commonly used in the default set by describing them as an enum.

  - class_name: Landmark
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      Class that defines any type of traffic landmark or sign affecting a road. These class mediates between the [OpenDRIVE 1.4 standard](http://www.opendrive.org/docs/OpenDRIVEFormatSpecRev1.4H.pdf) definition of the landmarks and their representation in the simulation.
      This class retrieves all the information defining a landmark in OpenDRIVE and facilitates information about which lanes does it affect and when.

      Landmarks will be accessed by carla.Waypoint objects trying to retrieve the regulation of their lane. Therefore some attributes depend on the waypoint that is consulting the landmark and so, creating the object.
    # - PROPERTIES -------------------------
    instance_variables:
    - var_name: road_id
      type: int
      doc: >
        The OpenDRIVE ID of the road where this landmark is defined. Due to OpenDRIVE road definitions, this road may be different from the road the landmark is currently affecting. It is mostly the case in junctions where the road diverges in different routes.

        <small>Example: a traffic light is defined in one of the divergent roads in a junction, but it affects all the possible routes</small>
    - var_name: distance
      type: float
      var_units: meters
      doc: >
        Distance between the landmark and the waypoint creating the object (querying `get_landmarks` or `get_landmarks_of_type`).
    - var_name: s
      type: float
      var_units: meters
      doc: >
        Distance where the landmark is positioned along the geometry of the road `road_id`.
    - var_name: t
      type: float
      var_units: meters
      doc: >
        Lateral distance where the landmark is positioned from the edge of the road `road_id`.
    - var_name: id
      type: str
      doc: >

      type: carla.LandmarkOrientation
      var_units: degrees
      doc: >
        Indicates which lanes the landmark is facing towards to.
    - var_name: z_offset

    - def_name: get_lane_validities
      return: list(tuple(int))

        Returns which lanes the landmark is affecting to. As there may be specific lanes where the landmark is not effective, the return is a list of pairs containing ranges of the __lane_id__ affected:

        <small>Example: In a road with 5 lanes, being 3 not affected: [(from_lane1,to_lane2),(from_lane4,to_lane5)]</small>
