    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      This class defines objects containing lighting and weather specifications that can later be applied in carla.World. So far, these conditions only intervene with [sensor.camera.rgb](ref_sensors.md#rgb-camera). They neither affect the actor's physics nor other sensors.        
        Each of these parameters acts indepently from the rest. Increasing the rainfall will not automatically create puddles nor change the road's humidity. That makes for a better customization but means that realistic conditions need to be scripted. However an example of dynamic weather conditions working realistically can be found [here](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/blob/master/PythonAPI/examples/dynamic_weather.py). 
    # - PROPERTIES -------------------------
    instance_variables:
    - var_name: cloudiness
      type: float
      doc: >
        Values range from 0 to 100, being 0 a clear sky and 100 one completely covered with clouds. 
    # --------------------------------------
    - var_name: precipitation
      type: float
      doc: >
        Rain intensity values range from 0 to 100, being 0 none at all and 100 a heavy rain. 
    # --------------------------------------
    - var_name: precipitation_deposits
      type: float
      doc: >
        Determines the creation of puddles. Values range from 0 to 100, being 0 none at all and 100 a road completely capped with water. Puddles are created with static noise, meaning that they will always appear at the same locations. 
    # --------------------------------------
    - var_name: wind_intensity
      type: float
      doc: >
        Controls the strenght of the wind with values from 0, no wind at all, to 100, a strong wind. The wind does affect rain direction and leaves from trees, so this value is restricted to avoid animation issues. 
    # --------------------------------------
    - var_name: sun_azimuth_angle
      type: float
      var_units: degrees
      doc: >
        The azimuth angle of the sun. Values range from 0 to 360. Zero is an origin point in a sphere determined by Unreal Engine. 
    # --------------------------------------
    - var_name: sun_altitude_angle
      type: float
      var_units: degrees
      doc: >
        Altitude angle of the sun. Values range from -90 to 90 corresponding to midnight and midday each.
    # --------------------------------------
    - var_name: fog_density
      type: float
      doc: >
        Fog concentration or thickness. It only affects the RGB camera sensor. Values range from 0 to 100.
    # --------------------------------------
    - var_name: fog_distance
      type: float
      var_units: meters
      doc: >
        Fog start distance. Values range from 0 to infinite.
    # --------------------------------------
    - var_name: wetness
      type: float
      doc: >
        Wetness intensity. It only affects the RGB camera sensor. Values range from 0 to 100.
    # --------------------------------------
    - var_name: fog_falloff
      type: float
      doc: >
        Density of the fog (as in specific mass) from 0 to infinity. The bigger the value, the more dense and heavy it will be, and the fog will reach smaller heights. Corresponds to <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Actors/FogEffects/HeightFog/index.html#:~:text=Using%20Exponential%20Height%20Fog%20Features,-The%20sections%20below&text=Add%20a%20second%20fog%20layer,height%20falloff%2C%20and%20height%20offset">Fog Height Falloff</a> in the UE docs. <br> If the value is 0, the fog will be lighter than air, and will cover the whole scene. <br> A value of 1 is approximately as dense as the air, and reaches normal-sized buildings. <br> For values greater than 5, the air will be so dense that it will be compressed on ground level.
