  # - CLASSES ------------------------------
  classes:
  - class_name: Client
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      The Client connects CARLA to the server which runs the simulation. Both server and client contain a CARLA library (libcarla) with some differences that allow communication between them. Many clients can be created and each of these will connect to the RPC server inside the simulation to send commands. The simulation runs server-side. Once the connection is established, the client will only receive data retrieved from the simulation. Walkers are the exception. The client is in charge of managing pedestrians so, if you are running a simulation with multiple clients, some issues may arise. For example, if you spawn walkers through different clients, collisions may happen, as each client is only aware of the ones it is in charge of.

        The client also has a recording feature that saves all the information of a simulation while running it. This allows the server to replay it at will to obtain information and experiment with it. [Here](adv_recorder.md) is some information about how to use this recorder.

  - class_name: TrafficManager
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      The traffic manager is a module built on top of the CARLA API in C++. It handles any group of vehicles set to autopilot mode to populate the simulation with realistic urban traffic conditions and give the chance to user to customize some behaviours. The architecture of the traffic manager is divided in five different goal-oriented stages and a PID controller where the information flows until eventually, a carla.VehicleControl is applied to every vehicle registered in a traffic manager.

      - param_name: percentage
        type: float
        doc: >
          Percentage difference between intended speed and the current limit.
      doc: >
        Sets the difference the vehicle's intended speed and its current speed limit. Speed limits can be exceeded by setting the `perc` to a negative value.

        Default is 30. Exceeding a speed limit can be done using negative percentages.

      doc: >
        Sets if the Traffic Manager is responsible of updating the vehicle lights, or not.

        Default is __False__. The traffic manager will not change the vehicle light status of a vehicle, unless its auto_update_status is st to __True__.

      doc: >
        Enables or disables the hybrid physics mode. In this mode, vehicle's farther than a certain radius from the ego vehicle will have their physics disabled. Computation cost will be reduced by not calculating vehicle dynamics. Vehicles will be teleported.

        doc: >
          If __True__, the OSM mode is enabled.
      doc: >
        Enables or disables the OSM mode. This mode allows the user to run TM in a map created with the [OSM feature](tuto_G_openstreetmap.md). These maps allow having dead-end streets. Normally, if vehicles cannot find the next waypoint, TM crashes. If OSM mode is enabled, it will show a warning, and destroy vehicles when necessary.

          If __True__, the TM synchronous mode is enabled.
      doc: >
        Sets the Traffic Manager to [synchronous mode](adv_traffic_manager.md#synchronous-mode). In a [multiclient situation](adv_traffic_manager.md#multiclient), only the TM-Server can tick. Similarly, in a [multiTM situation](adv_traffic_manager.md#multitm), only one TM-Server must tick. Use this method in the client that does the world tick, and right after setting the world to synchronous mode, to set which TM will be the master while in sync.
      warning: >
        If the server is set to synchronous mode, the TM <b>must</b> be set to synchronous mode too in the same client that does the tick.

    - var_name: additional_width
      type: float
      param_units: meters
      doc: >
        Additional with applied junction lanes. Complex situations tend to occur at junctions, and a little increase can prevent vehicles from falling off the road.  __Default is `0.6`__.
    - var_name: smooth_junctions
      type: bool
      doc: >
        If __True__, the mesh at junctions will be smoothed to prevent issues where roads blocked other roads. __Default is `True`__.
    - var_name: enable_mesh_visibility
      type: bool
      doc: >
        If __True__, the road mesh will be rendered. Setting this to __False__ should reduce the rendering overhead.  __Default is `True`__.
    - var_name: enable_pedestrian_navigation
      type: bool
