    - def_name: show_recorder_file_info

        type: bool
        doc: >
          Show all detailed info, or just a summary
      doc: >

        We have the option to show all the details per frame, that includes all the traffic light states, position of all actors, and animations data.
    # --------------------------------------
    - def_name: show_recorder_collisions
      params:
      - param_name: filename
        type: str
        doc: >
          Name of the recorded file to load
      - param_name: category1
        type: single char
        doc: >
          Character specifying the category of the first actor
      - param_name: category2
        type: single char
        doc: >
          Character specifying the category of the second actor
      doc: >
        This will show which collisions were recorded in the file. We can use a filter for the collisions we want, using two categories.
        The categories can be:  
          'h' = Hero  
          'v' = Vehicle  
          'w' = Walker  
          't' = Traffic light  
          'o' = Other  
          'a' = Any  
        So, if you want to see only collisions about a vehicle and a walker, we would use for category1 'v' and category2 'w'.
        Or if you want all the collisions (filter off) you can use 'a' as both categories.

    - def_name: show_recorder_actors_blocked
      params:
      - param_name: filename
        type: str
        doc: >
          Name of the recorded file to load
      - param_name: min_time
        type: float
        doc: >
          How many seconds has to be stoped an actor to be considered as blocked
      - param_name: min_distance
        type: float
        doc: >
          How many centimeters needs to move the actor in order to be considered as moving, and not blocked
      doc: >
        Shows which actors seem blocked by some reason.
        The idea is to calculate which actors are not moving as much as 'min_distance' for a period of 'min_time'.
        By default min_time = 60 seconds (1 min) and min_distance = 100 centimeters (1 m).

    - def_name: replay_file
      params:
      - param_name: name
        type: str

          Name of the file.
      - param_name: start
        type: float
        doc: >
          Time in seconds where to start the playback. If it is negative, then it starts from the end.
      - param_name: duration
        type: float
        doc: >
          Id of the actor to follow. If this is 0 then camera is disabled
      - param_name: follow_id
        type: int
        doc: >

    # --------------------------------------
    - def_name: set_replayer_time_factor
      params:
      - param_name: time_factor
        type: float
        doc: >
          A value of 1.0 means normal time factor.
          A value < 1.0 means slow motion (for example 0.5 is half speed)
          A value > 1.0 means fast motion (for example 2.0 is double speed)
      doc: >
        Apply a different playback speed to current playback. Can be used several times while a playback is in curse.

    - def_name: apply_batch
      params:
      - param_name: commands
        type: list
        doc: >
          A list of commands to execute in batch. Each command has a different number of parameters.
          Currently, we can use these [commands](#command.ApplyAngularVelocity):  
            SpawnActor  
            DestroyActor  
            ApplyVehicleControl  
            ApplyWalkerControl  
            ApplyTransform  
            ApplyVelocity  
            AplyAngularVelocity  
            ApplyImpulse  
            SetSimulatePhysics  
            SetAutopilot  
      doc: >
        This function executes the whole list of commands on a single simulation step.
        For example, to set autopilot on some actors, we could use:  
        [sample_code](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/blob/10c5f6a482a21abfd00220c68c7f12b4110b7f63/PythonAPI/examples/spawn_npc.py#L126).  
        We don't have control about the response of each command. If we need that, we can use `apply_batch_sync()`.

    # --------------------------------------
    - def_name: apply_batch_sync
      params:
      - param_name: commands
        type: list
        doc: >
          A list of commands to execute in batch. For a list of commands available see function above apply_batch().
      - param_name: due_tick_cue
        type: bool
        doc: >
          A boolean parameter to specify whether or not to perform a carla.World.tick after applying the batch in _synchronous mode_.
      return: list
      doc: >
        This function executes the whole list of commands on a single simulation
        step, blocks until the commands are executed, and returns a list of
        [`command.Response`](#command.Response) that can be used to determine whether a single
        command succeeded or not.
