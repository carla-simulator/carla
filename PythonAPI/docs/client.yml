        If we use a simple name like 'recording.log' then it will be saved at server folder 'CarlaUE4/Saved/recording.log'.
        If we use some folder in the name, then it will be considered to be an absolute path, like '/home/carla/recording.log'.

        We have the option to show all the details per frame, that includes all the traffic light states, position of all actors, and animations data.

      doc: >
        This will show which collisions were recorded in the file. We can use a filter for the collisions we want, using two categories.
        The categories can be:  
          \- `h` = Hero  
          \- `v` = Vehicle  
          \- `w` = Walker  
          \- `t` = Traffic light  
          \- `o` = Other  
          \- `a` = Any  
        So, if you want to see only collisions about a vehicle and a walker, we would use for category1 'v' and category2 'w'.
        Or if you want all the collisions (filter off) you can use 'a' as categories.

        doc: >
          How many centimeters needs to displace an actor in order to not be considered as blocked
      doc: >
        Shows which actors seems blocked by some reason.
        The idea is to calculate which actors are not moving as much as 'min_distance' for a period of 'min_time'.
        By default min_time = 60 seconds (1 min) and min_distance = 100 centimeters (1 m).

        doc: >
          These values means:  
            \- A value of 1.0 means normal time factor.  
            \- A value < 1.0 means slow motion (for example 0.5 is half speed)  
            \- A value > 1.0 means fast motion (for example 2.0 is double speed)
      doc: >
        Apply a different playback speed to current playback. Can be used several times while a playback is in curse.
