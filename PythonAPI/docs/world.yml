  - class_name: WorldSettings
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      The simulation has some advanced configuration options that are contained in this class and can be managed using carla.World and its methods. These allow the user to choose between client-server synchrony/asynchrony, activation of "no rendering mode" and either if the simulation should run with a fixed or variable time-step. Check [this](adv_synchrony_timestep.md) out if you want to learn about it. 
    # - PROPERTIES -------------------------
    instance_variables:
    - var_name: synchronous_mode
      type: bool
      doc: >
        States the synchrony between client and server. When set to true, the server will wait for a client tick in order to move forward. It is false by default. 
    - var_name: no_rendering_mode
      type: bool
      doc: >
        When enabled, the simulation will run no rendering at all. This is mainly used to avoid overhead during heavy traffic simulations. It is false by default. 
    - var_name: fixed_delta_seconds
      type: float
      doc: >

    # --------------------------------------

  - class_name: AttachmentType
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      Class that defines attachment options between an actor and its parent. When spawning actors, these can be attached to another actor so their position changes accordingly. This is specially useful for sensors. The snipet in carla.World.spawn_actor shows some sensors being attached to a car when spawned. Note that the attachment type is declared as an enum within the class. 
      
    # - PROPERTIES -------------------------
    instance_variables:
    - var_name: Rigid
      doc: >
        With this fixed attatchment the object follow its parent position strictly. This is the recommended attachment to retrieve precise data from the simulation.  
    - var_name: SpringArm
      doc: >
        An attachment that expands or retracts the position of the actor, depending on its parent. This attachment is only recommended to record videos from the simulation where a smooth movement is needed. SpringArms are an Unreal Engine component so [check the UE docs](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Gameplay/HowTo/UsingCameras/SpringArmComponents/index.html) to learn more about them. <br><b style="color:red;">Warning:</b> The <b>SpringArm</b> attachment presents weird behaviors when an actor is spawned with a relative translation in the Z-axis (e.g. <code>child_location = Location(0,0,2)</code>).  
    # --------------------------------------

  - class_name: LabelledPoint
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      Class that represent a position in space with a semantic label.
    # - PROPERTIES -------------------------
    instance_variables:
    - var_name: location
      doc: >
        Position in 3D space.
    - var_name: label
      doc: >
        Semantic tag of the point.
    # --------------------------------------

  - class_name: World
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      World objects are created by the client to have a place for the simulation to happen. The world contains the map we can see, meaning the asset, not the navigation map. Navigation maps are part of the carla.Map class. It also manages the weather and actors present in it. There can only be one world per simulation, but it can be changed anytime. 
    # - PROPERTIES -------------------------
    instance_variables:
    - var_name: id
      type: int
      doc: >
        The ID of the episode associated with this world. Episodes are different sessions of a simulation. These change everytime a world is disabled or reloaded. Keeping track is useful to avoid possible issues.  
    - var_name: debug
      type: carla.DebugHelper
      doc: >
        Responsible for creating different shapes for debugging. Take a look at its class to learn more about it. 
    # - METHODS ----------------------------
    methods:    
    - def_name: apply_settings
      return: int
      params:
      - param_name: world_settings
        type: carla.WorldSettings
      doc: >
        This method applies settings contained in an object to the simulation running and returns the ID of the frame they were implemented. 
      warning: >
        If synchronous mode is enabled, and there is a Traffic Manager running, this must be set to sync mode too. Read [this](adv_traffic_manager.md#synchronous-mode) to learn how to do it.

    - def_name: on_tick
      return: int

        doc: > 
          Function with a snapshot as compulsory parameter that will be called when the client receives a tick.  
      doc: >
        This method is used in [__asynchronous__ mode](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adv_synchrony_timestep/). It starts callbacks from the client for the function defined as `callback`, and returns the ID of the callback. The function will be called everytime the server ticks. It requires a carla.WorldSnapshot as argument, which can be retrieved from __<font color="#7fb800">wait_for_tick()</font>__. Use __<font color="#7fb800">remove_on_tick()</font>__ to stop the callbacks.
    # --------------------------------------
    - def_name: remove_on_tick
      params:
      - param_name: callback_id
        type: callback
        doc: > 
          The callback to be removed. The ID is returned when creating the callback.

        param_units: seconds
        doc: > 
          Maximum time the server should wait for a tick. It is set to <code>10.0</code> by default.   
      doc: >
        This method is used in [__synchronous__ mode](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adv_synchrony_timestep/), when the server waits for a client tick before computing the next frame. This method will send the tick, and give way to the server. It returns the ID of the new frame computed by the server. 
      note: > 
        If no tick is received in synchronous mode, the simulation will freeze. Also, if many ticks are received from different clients, there may be synchronization issues. Please read the docs about [synchronous mode](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adv_synchrony_timestep/) to learn more.  
    # --------------------------------------

        param_units: seconds
        doc: > 
          Maximum time the server should wait for a tick. It is set to <code>10.0</code> by default.   
      doc: >
        This method is used in [__asynchronous__ mode](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adv_synchrony_timestep/). It makes the client wait for a server tick. When the next frame is computed, the server will tick and return a snapshot describing the new state of the world.

      doc: >
        The method will create, return and spawn an actor into the world. The actor will need an available blueprint to be created and a transform (location and rotation). It can also be attached to a parent with a certain attachment type.

      doc: >
        Retrieves a list of carla.Actor elements, either using a list of IDs provided or just listing everyone on stage. If an ID does not correspond with any actor, it will be excluded from the list returned, meaning that both the list of IDs and the list of actors may have different lengths.

  - class_name: DebugHelper
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      Helper class part of carla.World that defines methods for creating debug shapes. By default, shapes last one second. They can be permanent, but take into account the resources needed to do so. Take a look at the snipets available for this class to learn how to debug easily in CARLA.
