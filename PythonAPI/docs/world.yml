  - class_name: WorldSettings
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      The simulation has some advanced configuration options that are contained in this class and can be managed using carla.World and its methods. These allow the user to choose between client-server synchrony/asynchrony, activation of "no rendering mode" and either if the simulation should run with a fixed or variable time-step. Check [this](adv_synchrony_timestep.md) out if you want to learn about it. 
    # - PROPERTIES -------------------------
    instance_variables:
    - var_name: synchronous_mode
      type: bool
      doc: >
        States the synchrony between client and server. When set to true, the server will wait for a client tick in order to move forward. It is false by default. 
    - var_name: no_rendering_mode
      type: bool
      doc: >
        When enabled, the simulation will run no rendering at all. This is mainly used to avoid overhead during heavy traffic simulations. It is false by default. 
    - var_name: fixed_delta_seconds
      type: float
      doc: >
        Ensures that the time elapsed between two steps of the simulation is fixed. Set this to <b>0.0</b> to work with a variable time-step, as happens by default.
    - var_name: substepping
      type: bool
      doc: >
        Enable the physics substepping. This option allows computing some physics substeps between two render frames. If synchronous mode is set, the number of substeps and its time interval are fixed and computed are so they fulfilled the requirements of carla.WorldSettings.max_substeps and carla.WorldSettings.max_substep_delta_time. These last two parameters need to be compatible with carla.WorldSettings.fixed_delta_seconds. Enabled by default.
    - var_name: max_substep_delta_time
      type: float
      doc: >
       Maximum delta time of the substeps. If the carla.WorldSettings.max_substeps is high enough, the substep delta time would be always below or equal to this value. By default, the value is set to 0.01.
    - var_name: max_substeps
      type: int
      doc: >
        The maximum number of physics substepping that are allowed. By default, the value is set to 10.

      type: bool
      doc: >
        Defines wether to use deterministic physics for pedestrian death animations or physical ragdoll simulation. 
        When enabled, pedestrians have less realistic death animation but ensures determinism. 
        When disabled, pedestrians are simulated as ragdolls with more realistic simulation and collision but no determinsm can be ensured.
    - var_name: tile_stream_distance
      type: float
      doc: >
        Used for large maps only. Configures the maximum distance from the hero vehicle to stream tiled maps. Regions of the map within this range will be visible (and capable of simulating physics). Regions outside this region will not be loaded.
    - var_name: actor_active_distance
      type: float
      doc: >
        Used for large maps only. Configures the distance from the hero vehicle to convert actors to dormant. Actors within this range will be active, and actors outside will become dormant.
    - var_name: spectator_as_ego
      type: bool
      doc: >
        Used for large maps only. Defines the influence of the spectator on tile loading in Large Maps. By default, the spectator will provoke loading of neighboring tiles in the absence of an ego actor. This might be inconvenient for applications that immediately spawn an ego actor.

      Class that defines attachment options between an actor and its parent. When spawning actors, these can be attached to another actor so their position changes accordingly.

        An attachment like the previous one but that does not make the collision test, and that means that it does not expands or retracts the position of the actor.

      doc: >
        This method is used in [__asynchronous__ mode](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adv_synchrony_timestep/). It starts callbacks from the client for the function defined as `callback`, and returns the ID of the callback. The function will be called everytime the server ticks. It requires a carla.WorldSnapshot as argument, which can be retrieved from __<font color="#7fb800">wait_for_tick()</font>__. Use __<font color="#7fb800">remove_on_tick()</font>__ to stop the callbacks.

          Maximum time the server should wait for a tick. It is set to <code>10.0</code> by default.   
      doc: >
        This method is used in [__synchronous__ mode](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adv_synchrony_timestep/), when the server waits for a client tick before computing the next frame. This method will send the tick, and give way to the server. It returns the ID of the new frame computed by the server. 
      note: > 
        If no tick is received in synchronous mode, the simulation will freeze. Also, if many ticks are received from different clients, there may be synchronization issues. Please read the docs about [synchronous mode](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adv_synchrony_timestep/) to learn more.

        This method is used in [__asynchronous__ mode](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adv_synchrony_timestep/). It makes the client wait for a server tick. When the next frame is computed, the server will tick and return a snapshot describing the new state of the world.
