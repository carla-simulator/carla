Blueprint Library Module

This module provides functionality for managing CARLA vehicle and pedestrian blueprints,
including finding the best-fit blueprint based on dimensions and handling coordinate
transformations between bounding box centers and vehicle reference points.

The BlueprintLibrary class loads blueprint size data from JSON files and provides
methods to:
- Find the best matching blueprint for given dimensions
- Apply coordinate offsets between bounding box center and rear axle center
- Handle transformations for accurate vehicle positioning in CARLA
