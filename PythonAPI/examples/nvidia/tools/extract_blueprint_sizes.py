Blueprint Size Extraction Tool

This tool connects to a CARLA server, spawns each available vehicle and walker blueprint,
measures their bounding box dimensions, and saves the results to JSON files.

The extracted dimensions are used by the NUREC integration to correctly size objects
when replaying scenarios in CARLA.
